It sounds a bit flippant, yet it is a request that medical directors and underwriters see quite often.  An informal application or quick quote comes in with a request about “history of brain tumor.”  Or maybe a question of pancreatic cancer.  The underwriter is expected to make an educated guess based on these minimal findings.  All tumors truly aren’t created equal, and people have individualized responses to different abnormalities.  The more information supplied the better chance there is for not only a placeable but a sustainable quote.
