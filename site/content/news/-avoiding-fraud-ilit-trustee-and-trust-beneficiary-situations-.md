Companies have a variety of approaches for handling life insurance applications with an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) listed as owner and/or beneficiary. Some companies don’t ask for anything other than the trust’s tax identification number; some ask for a trust certification; others just ask for limited pages from the trust; and still others ask for a copy of the entire trust and utilize a committee review approach, often involving associates from advanced marketing/legal, agency, actuarial and underwriting departments.
