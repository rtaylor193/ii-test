N Terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro BNP) is produced by cardiac muscle cells (myocytes) in response to cardiac wall stress and to ischemia as well. NT-pro BNP has been shown to predict all-cause mortality in individuals without history of heart disease. This has been found in both insurance and general populations. It has also been found to improve future cardiovascular risk estimation when considered along with classic cardiovascular risk assessors.
