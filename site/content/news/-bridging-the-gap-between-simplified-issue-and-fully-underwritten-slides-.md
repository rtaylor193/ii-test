There is a huge chasm between the speed to issue a simplified issue policy, compared to a fully underwritten policy. This session will address new processes that have been developed to speed the current fully underwritten policy issue process without needing to go all the way to simplified issue assumptions. The experts will discuss new rapid diagnostic testing protocols offered in alternative test settings and other tools and techniques to improve speed to issue. The experts will also discuss how these processes can help improve the consistency and quality of underwriting evidence and potentially affect both not-taken rates and mortality assumptions.
