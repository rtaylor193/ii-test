Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) was originally described by Japanese authors in the 1990s. The name was derived from the Japanese word for octopus pot, due to the shape of the left ventricle (LV) at the end of systole, which resembles an octopus trap used by Japanese fishermen. It has been described under a remarkable number of different names in the literature including Broken Heart Syndrome, Stress Induced Cardiomyopathy and Apical Ballooning Syndrome.
