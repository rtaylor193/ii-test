Liver enzyme testing (LFTs) are part of virtually every blood profile obtained on a potential insured.  They are also one of the leading causes of a completely unexpected rating or decline on a case.  Most clients do not provide a specific history for an elevation, and no broker or agent expects such an outcome with what seemed to be a clean history.  Knowing how to approach this situation can be key to a favorable underwriting outcome.
