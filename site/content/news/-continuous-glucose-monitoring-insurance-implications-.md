Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) allows for real-time measurement of blood glucose, and is a technology being used by an estimated 7 million individuals in the U.S. and growing. In On the Risk, RGA's Drs. Dave Rengachary and Lauren Garfield explore the ways a sensor placed under the skin can now provide an extremely detailed picture of glucose homeostasis.
