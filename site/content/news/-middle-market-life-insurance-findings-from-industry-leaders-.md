The Society of Actuariesâ€™ Marketing and Distribution Section (MAD) announce the release of a new report on the middle-income life insurance market.  Success has been limited in this market even though over the last 10 years, a number of studies and ideas have been presented as viable strategies for serving the middle market. Authored by Doug Bennett with assistance from Stephen Camilli of ACTEX Learning, this report seeks to understand this lack of success and document the experiences of companies and distributors with significant working knowledge of the middle-income market.
