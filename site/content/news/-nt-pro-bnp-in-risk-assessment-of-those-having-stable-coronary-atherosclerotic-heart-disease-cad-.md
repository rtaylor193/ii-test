N Terminal-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro BNP) is produced by cardiac muscle cells (myocytes) in response to cardiac wall stress and myocardial ischemia. NT-pro BNP has been shown to predict all-cause mortality in insurance applicants without a history of heart disease, as well as in the general population. It has been found to improve future cardiovascular risk estimation when considered along with classic cardiovascular risk assessors. It has also been identified as an indicator of future mortality risk in those having stable coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD)
