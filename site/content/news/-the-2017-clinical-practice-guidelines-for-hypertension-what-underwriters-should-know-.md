The American College of Cardiology and The American Heart Association published the new “2017 Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults” on November 13, 2017. The new guidelines propose lower thresholds for diagnosing and lower goals for treating hypertension than the previous recommendations of 2003, especially for individuals at high risk for adverse future cardiovascular events.
