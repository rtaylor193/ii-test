Prospects are generally upbeat in 2015 for providers of life insurance and annuities in the US. Insurers can expect to build upon recent improvements in annuity sales, as credit rates continue to increase and customers return to simplified, tax-deferred products. Life insurance sales will benefit from rising levels of consumer confidence and personal wealth, both driven by the ongoing economic recovery and expectations for gradual increases in interest rates.
