The advent of electronic health records (EHRs) brings to mind a story I like to tell. I was developing a ruleset for an automated underwriting rules engine 20 years ago when the IT director brought up a point during dinner. He said, “You underwriters really like your medical records. Well, I need them in an electronic data format with a dedicated field containing diagnostic codes. Then I can use those codes to assign an automated risk class.”
