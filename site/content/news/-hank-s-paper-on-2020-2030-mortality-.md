We must chart a course that continues producing robust mortality gains absolutely critical to our bottom lines â€¦ despite the challenges posed by the incipient 2020 Great Recession and the protean consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article identifies and discusses core factors that I believe will determine how all of this sorts out over the next decade. It also suggests how we can greatly minimize mortality-related adversities via prudent changes in how we underwrite life insurance.
