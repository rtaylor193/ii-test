The life insurance protection gap remains an issue in the United States. Swiss Re research estimates the gap between the life coverage families should have for income protection, versus what they actually have, at $20 trillion in aggregate in 2010. This is up from $18 trillion in 2001 after adjusting for inflation. The average family has a gap of $378,000, up from $347,000.
