Chikungunya fever (CHK) is a febrile illness associated with severe arthralgia and rash. CHK was first identified in Tanzania in the early 1952 and has caused periodic outbreaks in Asia and Africa since the 1960s. The virus is transmitted from human to human by vectors, infected Aedes aegypti and/ or Aedes albopictus female mosquitoes.
