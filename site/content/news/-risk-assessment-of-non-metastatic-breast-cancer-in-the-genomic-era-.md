Underwriting breast cancer in 2017 will require an understanding of the current and growing role of genomics in the assessment of its mortality risk. This is not to lessen the importance of well-known prognosticators such as tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) staging, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) and human epidermal receptor growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status, grade, or the mitotic activity index (MAI). Rather, it is to keep abreast of additional genomics-based prognostic tools that can be used to further stratify breast cancer and its risks.
