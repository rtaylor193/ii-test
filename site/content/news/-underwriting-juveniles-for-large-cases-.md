Life insurance for juveniles has been a fairly simple proposition. Most insurers offer a Juvenile Coverage rider to a parent’s policy for a nominal face amount and charge. Others offer stand-alone low face whole life policies. Coverage traditionally has been for final expense (the rider) or as a primer for the child’s savings (whole life).
