John Hancock Insurance today announced an expansion of its game-changing John Hancock Vitality solution with the addition of the HealthyFood program. Now, John Hancock Vitality policyholders can earn rewards for the healthy food choices they make every day with real-time discounts and/or cash-back up to $600 a year on their grocery bills, and program points that lead to savings on their annual premiums -- as much as 15 percent.
