We are hosting a 1-day seminar on Thursday, October 13, on this critical medical underwriting topic.

Cancer accounts for a disproportionate share of death and morbidity claims within 2 years. It is possible to detect some of these cases during underwriting. This unique seminar provides all underwriters need to know to do so.

Hank will present 4 lectures on various aspects of this subject. Dr. Bob Stout (Clinical Reference Laboratory) and Scott Whitmore (Milliman Intelliscript) will each present a lecture as well. Bob will speak about a method to screen for occult cancer and Scott will focus on medications that are RED FLAGS for a high risk of undisclosed cancer.

The seminar is in downtown Milwaukee at our 5-star Pfister Hotel. Most underwriters can fly/drive in and out the same day. The others will enjoy the evening before in this grand hotel with an incredibly low rate.
