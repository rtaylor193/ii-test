Universal life insurance has been available in a variety of permutations since its creation in the late 1970s. Today, policies with death benefits in excess of US$10 million are purchased exclusively by customers with more than $1 million in investable assets – high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) – and play vital roles in estate planning and asset allocation strategies.

This report aims to show how primary life insurers can explore or strengthen their existing presence in this brokered international market by developing successful strategies that can optimize market presence and penetration.
