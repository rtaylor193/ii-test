Sometimes when we introduce a new requirement or get challenged by an agent or broker about the use of a test, it’s helpful to have a generic document to explain in simple terms what it is and why we use it.

We were recently asked by an insurer to write a short piece for producer consumption on NT-proBNP. They were on the cusp of replacing ECGs with NT-proBNP and wanted an efficient way of explaining their decision as well as telling their producers what
NT-proBNP.

This is what we came up with.

If this is of any value to you, please feel free to use it.

If you decide to leave it unedited, you can leave my name and short bio on it to potentially increase its credibility a tad.

On the other hand, if you decide to modify it, go for it…but please leave off my name and bio if you choose this option.

Cheers,

Hank
