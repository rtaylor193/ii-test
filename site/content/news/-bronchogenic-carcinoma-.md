Things should certainly be looking up in terms of bronchogenic carcinoma (lung cancer).  The number one cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, less and less people are smoking than ever before.  According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2016 statistics, the percentage of smokers in the period since World War II has dropped from over 43 percent to under 16 percent of U.S. adults.  And newer treatments for lung cancer are being broadcast on television advertisements regularly.  It should certainly mean improved underwriting with this disease by all standards.
