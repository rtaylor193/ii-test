In a response to the uncertainties COVID-19 has brought to the world, Swiss Re is opening access to its proprietary Life Guide underwriting manual to all life and health insurers for 90 days (from 27 April to 31 July 2020). The offer is designed to help life and health insurers navigate todayâ€™s crisis, better understand all risks they underwrite and give them confidence in offering coverage at a time when more people are thinking about life insurance and re-evaluating their financial situations.
