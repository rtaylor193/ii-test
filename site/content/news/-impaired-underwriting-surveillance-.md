While it sounds like something Joe Friday of Dragnet or the FBI would do, medical surveillance involves the following of a condition before deciding whether or when to take a definitive action of treatment. The waiting period can precede a possible surgery, a medical intervention, or an institution of therapy that disrupts the status quo. Thatâ€™s what surveillance truly is: Waiting and watching before deciding whether to take an action that will disrupt the status quo.
