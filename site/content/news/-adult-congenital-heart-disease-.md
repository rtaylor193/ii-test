The definition of congenital heart disease (CHD) is the persistence of any structural abnormality of the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. Those patients with CHD who achieve adulthood are considered to have adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). This is a very heterogenous group, consisting of multiple types of lesions and various stages of repair.
