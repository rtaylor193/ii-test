This edition of ReFlections contains an in-depth review of the role of genetics in the rapidly changing diagnostic criteria, risk stratification, and treatment of individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RGA also discusses the relatively new but increasingly popular Cancer Reimbursement product and its design, underwriting and claims issues. ReCite, a medical literature review section, has articles of interest to both underwriters and medical directors.
