Welcome to the 7th edition of SCORacle, which contains some variation to the usual Underwriting and Claims focus and includes articles by 3 young students that spent some time with SCOR in the summer to provide their views of our industry. This provides a fascinating insight into the thoughts of our consumers of the future. In addition, we also have some interesting information from our Consultant Cardiologist on two commonly seen conditions that from an underwriting perspective we should keep an eye on and for our readers who are Claims assessors, we include some information relating to changes to death certification.
