Private long-term care insurance (LTCI) is now in its fourth decade - the last, in the view of some, in which it will be sold widely across America. Before we observe the obsequies, it may be well to take stock of where we actually are, because sales of stand-alone LTCI products - not to mention linked or combination products, chronic illness coverage, and short-term care insurance - do take place each day, suggesting that private LTCI is filling a need.
