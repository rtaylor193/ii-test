Munich Re assessed the effectiveness of physical activity as measured by wearable sensors in stratifying the mortality risk profile of a U.S. population-based dataset provided by Vivametrica. Munich Re examined the dataset, performed classical actuarial mortality analysis and used survival analysis and machine learning techniques to evaluate the extent to which physical activity predicts mortality.
