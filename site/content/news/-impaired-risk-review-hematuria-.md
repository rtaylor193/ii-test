Quite simply, hematuria is defined as the presence of blood in the urine. It can be obvious to the clinician (frank hematuria) or not visible to the naked eye (microscopic hematuria). The large majority of instances in insurance underwriting are picked up incidentally from the submitted urine sample. The critical question then is which cases are significant, which have benign causes, and which need additional investigation before underwriting can continue.
