Build is one of the essential points of information in underwriting that go into a rating. Generally, height and weight are calculated into a measure called BMI, which is body mass index. Most companies make build tables available to their agents and brokers to allow a general idea of whether or not there will be debits on a case. However, more things go into an assessment than just absolute measures, so companies may vary on how they perceive build information.
