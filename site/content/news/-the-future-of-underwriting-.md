The “forecasting” issue of Broker World wouldn’t be complete without a look into the future of medical underwriting. Will a person come to our house, swab the inside of our cheek, and be done with the medical end of things? Will we step into a machine that records height, weight, lean body mass and then proceed to CT scan our entire body? And even if they could, would we let them? The sky may be the limit, but we as a government and privacy protective population may not let it get that far.
