The process by which companies choose to implement this program may not be as accelerated as the name itself. Companies looking to adopt, enhance or evaluate accelerated underwriting should come listen to how some companies think about, evaluate and share lessons learned about designing, implementing and monitoring an accelerated underwriting paradigm, its impact on assumptions and products, and how a reinsurer may review the accelerated program.
